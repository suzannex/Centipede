This is a version of the classic arcade game Centipede, written in the ISL+ teaching language version of the functional programming language Racket.

The game is run as an animation that accepts key input to control a player at the bottom of the screen who can move back and forth and shoot bullets at a moving centipede. The centipede moves back and forth on a field of mushrooms, moving down a row whenever it hits a mushroom. When the player shoots a centipede, it splits at the point of impact into two centipedes. Players can shoot mushrooms, which take four hits to be eliminated from the screen. When a centipede reaches the player, the player dies and the game is over. If a centipede reaches the bottom of the screen and does not hit the player, it starts moving back up the screen. The player wins the game by shooting all the centipedes. 

The code is organized into the following sections:
- Data definitions (World struct, how centipede/player/bullet/mushrooms are represented)
- Helper functions
- Player-related functions (movement, shooting bullet)
- Centipede-related functions (movement, splitting, removal)
- Mushroom-related functions (mushroom health decrementing, removal)
- Bullet-related functions (movement, centipede and mushroom collision check)
- Animation, key handling, and rendering functions
